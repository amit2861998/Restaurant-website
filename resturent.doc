Food joints across Bhubaneswar
Budget Rs 50-75 per head –
1) Andhra Mess – Back side of Info-City, by far the best vegetarian food available across all of Bhubaneswar. The Lady Finger Fry, Potato Fry, Upma, Upma-Pesara, Gobi Fry, Gobi Chilli-Dry, Green Dal, Sambhar, Rasam, Rasam-Vada, Sambhar –Vada and Lady Finger Curry are must haves. I recommend ordering the Thali, It consists of Rice, Roti, Dal, Sambhar, Rasam, Curd, Fry Vegetable of the Day, Vegetable Curry of the Day, Pickle, Red Chutney and Papad; at rupees forty all items in the meal are unlimited other than roti, rice and curd.
2) Hotel Pria – Near Keshari Cinema, One of the best Udipi restaurants in Bhubaneshwar. Our last meal for six cost us Rs 240. The Puri-Bhaji, Sambhar-Vada, Idli-Sambhar, Sambhar-Paratha (Kerela Paratha), Upma, Rava-Dossa, Ras-Malai and Filter Coffee are all highly recommended.
3) Chappan Bhog – Take the right turn leading towards the back side off Pal Heights from Jaidev Vihar. This is the closest chaat corner from our campus. Raj Kachori, Chole-Bhature, Chaat, Tikki-Chole and Jalebis are their speciality. They also have a wide variety of Indian Sweets.
4) Shree Kunj – Across the road from Chappan Bhog. Similar fare and prices to Chappan Bhog but the Gujrati/Rajasthani Thali is really great.
5) Pakwaan – On the road that extends behind The Crown Hotel to ID Market, can also be reached via Mayfair. Our last meal for two cost us Rs. 90. The Black Dal (Ma Ki Daal) at rupees thirty for a half plate is brilliant and so is the Paneer Tikka Masala. They also serve a variety of non-vegetarian dishes extending from chicken to mutton to sea food.
6) Govinda’s at Iskon Temple – Located inside the Iskon temple premises on NH5, they serve excellent all vegetarian meals starting from rupees 40, you also get fresh fruit juices of varieties of fruits that are locally considered exotic for Rs. 15.
7) Roll Stall – Inside the Reliance Fresh premises at ID market. Order the Double Egg Double Chicken Roll at rupees 60, its equivalent to purchasing three rolls from any other joint in Bhubaneswar. But this place is strictly for Non-Vegetarians, they only serve paneer for vegetarians, but yes you could try the vegetarian momos at 50 rupees for ten pieces.
8) Street Stalls – Outside the Levis showroom at Shahid Nagar. Have the Pav Bhaji at rupees fifteen a plate, follow it up with the Chaat at rupees twelve a plate and finally end with a Grilled Cheese Chilli Sandwich at rupees twenty.

Budget Rs 75-100 per head
1) Vineeth – At Master Canteen. Their specialities are Chole-Bhature, Pav Bhaji, Tikki-Chole, Samosas, Kachoris, Raj Kachoris and a variety of Indian sweets. They really are very good at what they do. A meal for three last cost us about Rs. 200.
2) Venus – Bapuji Nagar. It’s a landmark by itself. Order anything from the vast menu and its bound to be good and in most cases great. A meal for four last cost us Rs 250. But non-vegetarians beware; it’s a purely vegetarian joint.
3) South Indian Restaurant – Bapuji Nagar, same lane as Venus. Similar fare too most Udipi restaurants, but amazing quality. They do a better job of some dishes as compared to Priya but that also explains the higher prices.
4) Kamat’s - Old Town, Bhubaneswar. The only place other than Mayfair which serves coconut chutney rather than the crushed dal white chutney that most other joints in Bhubaneswar dish out.
5) Smack – Chandrashekharpur. The best place for authentic North-Eastern-Indian food. The momos and thukas are brilliant. An average bill of about 80-90 per head should be expected.
6) Cafe Italiano – Chandrashekharpur, beside Smack. The only place in Bhubaneswar that serves Espressos starting from as little as Rs. 30. They also have home style pizzas, grilled sandwiches and burgers. Also they let you lounge about for as long as you like.
7) Cream and Spice – Bapuji Nagar, take the first left after the Reebok Store. Its a quaint little bakery and confectionary. They may not have much to offer on display, but you should order their variety of Grilled Sandwiches and Burgers, truly awesome. They also supply breakfast for the Governor.
8) Food Box – Shahid Nagar, recently re-opened. Serves the most awesome Chicken Champ (Chicken cooked in Mustard Gravy) as well as a Mustard Marinated Chicken Kebab Roll. Also has amazing momos (rupees thirty for six). A non vegetarian’s delight.

Budget Rs 100 – 150 per head
1) Royal – Shahid Nagar, Lane beside Levis Showroom, behind Appetite. The best place for Mutton in Bhubaneswar. A non-vegetarian’s delight, vegetarians please avoid. The Mutton Biryani, Mutton Tawa Kebab, Mutton Liver Fry, Chicken Butter Masala, Chicken Mughlai Paratha and Mutton Mughlai Paratha are some of the best non vegetarian dishes I’ve had in Bhubaneswar.
2) Country Kitchen – Bapuji Nagar, The original Country Kitchen is practically a landmark. Have the Double Egg Large Chicken Roll (Rs 37), Reshmi Kebab (Rs 80 for eight), Pahari Kebab (Rs 65 for six) or the Reshmi TIkka Masala (Rs 90 for a full serving) or the Chicken Tikka Masala (Rs 90 for a full serving). You can be done with your meal in as little as Rs 75 per head if you stick to ordering rolls but ordering kebabs will set you back by about Rs 120 per head.
3) Vijay’s Tandoori Delights – Bapuji Nagar, Straight down the road from Venus. Another Non Vegetarians’ paradise. They serve some of the best tikkas and biryanis but only chicken and paneer. The Tandoori Delight that has come up opposite Kalinga Hospital is an imposter so beware.
4) The Kalinga – Kalinga Chowk, take the left from Kalinga Chowk. It’s a budget paradise. A Chicken Biryani costs Rs 70, while you sit in an air conditioned restaurant with pretty decent ambience, add to that the biryani actually is quite good. Our last meal for two cost us about rupees 250.
5) Solah Anna – A little before Damana Square, above the Titan Eye Showroom. Its a Bengali speciality restaurant. The food is excellent and you will be quite stuffed for about rupees one forty per head.
6) Cookies Premium – Shahid Nagar, Take the first left after Khimji on Janpath. The coolest cafe in the city. The coffees are good and worth the money (espressos priced between 40 -60). For non-vegetarians try the Tangy Chicken (at Rs 95 its sufficiently filling for a meal) for vegetarians I’d suggest the Mint-Paneer Pizza. Chocolate lovers should make it a point to have a Maroon Tart (thick chocolate cream on the outside with melted chocolate on the inside).
7) Green Chilliz – Shahid Nagar. Another one for chicken lovers. This place has a number of branches all over the city (8 at last count) but the ones at Master Canteen and Shahid Nagar are the best. Order the special chicken biryani or the malai kebab, they are both equally awesome. For sea food lovers the prawn chilli is a delight.

Budget Rs 150-250
1) Sai Bhog – Master Canteen. A must visit for every vegetarian. They offer an unlimited thali at Rs 175 with fare ranging from Punjabi to Rajasthani to Gujarati.
2) Tangerine – Master Canteen. A great place for both vegetarians and non vegetarians. They have an extensive menu and decent food.
3) Lal Quila – Patia. Opposite the Big Bazaar at Patia. The joint has an awesome variety of Fish, Chicken, Mutton and Vegetable Tandooris. The ambience is decent and well spaced with not too many people. But please avoid eating the rolls. The meals are slightly higher priced by Bhubaneswar standards.
4) Silver Streak – Nayapalli, above the Nayapalli branch of ICICI. This is a Chinese restaurant and Barista Cafe in one. The food is generally good and the coffees are well made. A non vegetarian meal would set you back by about rupees two hundred per head.
5) Haka – Opposite Keshari cinema. Another Chinese joint. Ordering a la carte here is slightly expensive, with a per head bill of about three hundred. But you could try their lunch buffet at rupees one eighty per head or their dinner buffet at rupees two fifty per head. But do make it a point to check out the menu for the day before sitting down to your meal, on some days the buffet may be a bit lacking.
6) Deep Down South - Kharvel Nagar, Opposite Ram Mandir.

Budget Rs 250 – 400
1) Zaika – Pal Heights, Really good Indian food, awesome ambience and better service than most places around here.
2) RMH – Master Canteen, The Royal Mid-Town Hotel is the only budget option if you are searching for continental food. The Prawn Nuberg, Chicken In White Sauce and Fish Steak are all good options. Not many options in vegetarian though. You could also try their Indian food, but their popularity lies in their continental.
3) Mama Mia – Mayfair Lagoon

Budget Rs 400+
1) Bling it on - Marrion
2) Mirch Masala - Marrion
3) Kabaabs Unlimited - HHI
4) Kebab-e-que - Marrion
5) Tea Pot - Mayfair
